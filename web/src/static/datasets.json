In this context, we developed MetaNutriUnify, the first collection of curated and harmonized metagenomic data with unified nutritional data from public study cohorts, with a particular attention on fiber. Overview of the public studies included in MetaNutriUnify MetaNutriUnify is composed of 21 harmonized and curated public projects with available shotgun metagenomes from human adults stool samples and nutritional and anthropometric data. It consists of 949 individuals from 15 countries, totalizing 1656 metagenomes, from which we generated microbial species and associated functional modules abundance tables. We also unified nutritional data, including diet type, study type (observational/interventional), time points for stool sampling, diet intervention and associated information, macro and micronutrients when available, and reported available anthropometric data (gender, country, age, weight, height, BMI).

QC validation was performed using fastp (version 0.23.4) and host related reads were filtered out with bowtie using the human reference genome (Homo sapiens T2T-CHM13v2.0). Resulting high quality reads were mapped onto the 10.4 million gut IGC2 catalogue of the human microbiome and onto the 8.4 million human oral microbial catalogue using the METEOR software clustered into Metagenomic Species Pangenomes (MSP species) that were previously taxonomically and functionally annotated. MetaNutriUnify characteristics The provided data consists of: Metagenomic Species Pangenomes (MSP) species abundance table and related GTDB taxonomy (GTBD-tk version r220) (final_msp.7z and species_taxonomy_20241119.tab) KEGG, GMM and GBM Functional modules abundance table and related modules definition (KEGG version 107, GMM modules and GBM modules) (final_modules.tab and all_modules_definition_GMM_GBM_KEGG_107_20241119.tab) Manually curated and unified data collected from bioprojects (final_metadata.tab): Metadata from the metagenomes obtained from ENA, as well as nutritional and anthropometric data. Additional data on each sample, such as the evaluation of cross contamination within each bioproject using the CroCodeEL tool, together with the number of high quality reads, the MSP species richness and if the number of reads was below 1M. We proposed a “to_exclude” variable in the deposited MetaNutriUnify file, derived from these data. If one of the following conditions was met: low_read = YES, is.contaminated = YES or MSP_richness < 20, we propose to exclude the sample from downstream analysis. Nutritional data, carefully extracted from each study and reporting information on diet type, energy, macro- and micronutrients when available. No frequency data were included, because of the great variability between studies. We reported variables and their modalities as they were described in the different studies, and only modified units of nutritional data when appropriate. We encourage users to modulate the modalities for some variables, such as time point description, and to refer to the original studies for any enquiries. Anthropometric data, including country, gender, age, weight, height and BMI. General information on the cohorts, such as reference, study design, country, number of subjects and metagenomes, diet type and reported nutritional records (cohorts.xlsx) Legends for cohorts and final_metadata files (cohorts.xlsx) Codes for data recovery and harmonization are available here.

While short-read (SR) sequencing has historically enabled broad insights at gene-level diversity, its limited read length constrains the reconstruction of complete genomes. Conversely, HiFi-LR sequencing enhances the quality and completeness of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), enabling higher-resolution taxonomic and functional annotation. However, the high cost and relatively low throughput of HiFi-LR sequencing can limit genome recovery, particularly at the binning stage, where coverage depth is critical. Results Here, we present a novel hybrid strategy that differs from classical hybrid assemblies, where SR and LR reads are jointly used at the assembly step. Instead, we use high-depth SR data to inform the binning of HiFi-LR contigs. Using both SR and HiFi-LR metagenomic datasets generated from a tunnel-cultivated soil sample, we demonstrate that SR-derived coverage profiles significantly improve the binning of HiFi-LR assemblies. This results in a substantial increase in the number and quality of recovered MAGs compared to using HiFi-LR data alone. Conclusion Our findings highlight that, even in the context of HiFi reads, combining SR and LR remains beneficial in highly diverse environments, such as soil, not for hybrid assembly per se, but to enhance the downstream binning process. This cost-effective hybrid binning approach provides a practical framework for maximising genome recovery in complex microbiomes.","published_at":"2025-10-20T09:40:02Z","publisher":"Carole Belliardo Dataverse","citationHtml":"Belliardo, Carole; Frioux Cl&eacute;mence, 2025, \"Soil Metagenome Binning\", <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.57745/NRED6I\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.57745/NRED6I</a>, Recherche Data Gouv, V1, UNF:6:wnXtaGKEnvAISmdrQtC0xA== [fileUNF]","identifier_of_dataverse":"Soil_Metagenomics_Collection","name_of_dataverse":"Carole Belliardo Dataverse","citation":"Belliardo, Carole; Frioux Clémence, 2025, \"Soil Metagenome Binning\", https://doi.org/10.57745/NRED6I, Recherche Data Gouv, V1, UNF:6:wnXtaGKEnvAISmdrQtC0xA== [fileUNF]","storageIdentifier":"inrae://10.57745/NRED6I","keywords":["metagenomic"],"subjects":["Earth and Environmental Sciences","Computer and Information Science","Agricultural Sciences"],"fileCount":64,"versionId":277428,"versionState":"RELEASED","majorVersion":1,"minorVersion":0,"createdAt":"2025-04-29T13:11:54Z","updatedAt":"2025-10-20T09:40:02Z","contacts":[{"name":"Belliardo, Carole","affiliation":"INRAE"}],"producers":["Institut Sophia Agrobiotech"],"authors":["Belliardo, Carole","Frioux Clémence"]},{"name":"Improvement of eukaryotic protein predictions from soil metagenomes","type":"dataset","url":"https://doi.org/10.15454/E2VTRB","global_id":"doi:10.15454/E2VTRB","description":"During the last decades, metagenomics has highlighted the diversity of microorganisms from environmental or host-associated samples. Most metagenomics public repositories use annotation pipelines tailored for prokaryotes regardless of the taxonomic origin of contigs. Consequently, eukaryotic contigs with intrinsically different gene features, are not optimally annotated. Using a bioinformatics pipeline, we have filtered 7.9 billion contigs from 6,872 soil metagenomes in the JGI's IMG/M database to identify eukaryotic contigs. We have re-annotated genes using eukaryote-tailored methods, yielding 8 million eukaryotic proteins and over 300,000 orphan proteins lacking homology in public databases. Comparing the gene predictions we made with initial JGI ones on the same contigs, we confirmed our pipeline improves eukaryotic proteins completeness and contiguity in soil metagenomes. The improved quality of eukaryotic proteins combined with a more comprehensive assignment method yielded more reliable taxonomic annotation. This dataset of eukaryotic soil proteins with improved completeness, quality and reliable taxonomic annotation is of interest for any scientist aiming at studying the composition, biological functions and gene flux in soil communities involving eukaryotes.","published_at":"2022-04-13T14:40:51Z","publisher":"Data INRAE","citationHtml":"Belliardo, Carole; Georgios Koutsovoulos; Corinne Rancurel; Mathilde Cl&eacute;ment; Justine Lipuma; Marc Bailly-Bechet; Etienne Danchin, 2021, \"Improvement of eukaryotic protein predictions from soil metagenomes\", <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.15454/E2VTRB\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.15454/E2VTRB</a>, Recherche Data Gouv, V4, UNF:6:M3HKoGlQqmPSVYz9Bxidvg== [fileUNF]","identifier_of_dataverse":"inrae","name_of_dataverse":"Data INRAE","citation":"Belliardo, Carole; Georgios Koutsovoulos; Corinne Rancurel; Mathilde Clément; Justine Lipuma; Marc Bailly-Bechet; Etienne Danchin, 2021, \"Improvement of eukaryotic protein predictions from soil metagenomes\", https://doi.org/10.15454/E2VTRB, Recherche Data Gouv, V4, UNF:6:M3HKoGlQqmPSVYz9Bxidvg== [fileUNF]","storageIdentifier":"inrae://10.15454/E2VTRB","keywords":["Metagenomic; Eukaryote; Microorganisms; Proteins prediction; Soil; Terrestrial; Plant-associated"],"subjects":["Computer and Information Science","Agricultural Sciences"],"fileCount":11,"versionId":264324,"versionState":"RELEASED","majorVersion":4,"minorVersion":1,"createdAt":"2021-10-05T14:01:23Z","updatedAt":"2022-05-17T07:44:31Z","contacts":[{"name":"Belliardo, Carole","affiliation":"INRAE"}],"publications":[{}],"geographicCoverage":[{"country":""}],"authors":["Belliardo, Carole","Georgios Koutsovoulos","Corinne Rancurel","Mathilde Clément","Justine Lipuma","Marc Bailly-Bechet","Etienne Danchin"]},{"name":"Fermented vegetables metavirome - shotgun metagenomic dataset","type":"dataset","url":"https://doi.org/10.57745/LHXYD9","global_id":"doi:10.57745/LHXYD9","description":"This dataset contains shotgun metagenomics data produced from twelve fermented vegetables: four cabbages (sauerkraut), four carrots and four turnips (sauerruben).

How to use this dataset To perform taxonomic, functionnal and strain level profiling with this dataset, we suggest using Meteor. Methods Data sources This dataset was constructed using the samples of the MetaChick project (phase 1) corresponding to the cecal content of 340 animals. Sequencing data and associated metadata have been submitted to INSDC (bioproject: PRJEB38174). Sequencing data QC and metagenomic assembly First, sequencing adapters removal and read trimming was performed with fastxtend. Reads mapped on the host genome (GRCg7b GCA_016699485.1) with bowtie2 were removed with samtools. Finally, metagenomic assembly was performed with metaSPAdes v3.14.1. Contigs of less than 1500 bp were removed. MAGs recovery MAGs were generated with MetaBAT 2 (multi-coverage mode) and MAGs quality was assessed with CheckM. MAGs with completeness < 70% or contamination > 5% or N50 < 8Kb were discarded. Pairwise Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) was computed for all recovered MAGs with fastANI and dereplication at species level (ANI cutoff = 95%). Non-redundant gene catalog Genes were predicted on all contigs from metagenomic assemblies with Prodigal (parameters : -m -p meta). Genes were pooled and clustered with cd-hit-est (parameters -c 0.95 -aS 0.90 -G 0 -d 0 -M 0 -T 0) by choosing those from the longest contigs as representatives. MSPs recovery A raw gene abundance table (13,6M genes quantified in 340 samples) was generated with meteorMeteor. Then, co-abundant genes were binned in Metagenomic Species Pan-genomes (MSPs, i.e. gene clusters that likely belong to the same microbial species) using MSPminer. MAGs and MSPs taxonomic annotation Dereplicated MAGs were annotated with GTDB-Tk based on GTDB r214. Then, MAGs taxonomic annotation was propagated to the corresponding MSPs.

Methods Gene catalog construction The methodology for creating the IGC2 catalog is described in the original papers: Li et al., 2014 and Wen et al., 2017 MSP creation Reads from publicly available human gut metagenomes were aligned against the IGC2 catalog with the Meteor to produce a raw gene abundance table (10.4M genes quantified in >2000 samples). Then, co-abundant genes were binned in 1,989 Metagenomic Species Pan-genomes (MSPs, i.e. clusters of co-abundant genes that likely belong to the same microbial species) using MSPminer. MSPs taxonomic annotation MSPs taxonomic annotation was performed by aligning MSP core and accessory genes against representative genomes of the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB r207) using blastn (task = megablast, word_size = 16). The 20 best hits for each gene were kept (--max-target-seq 20). Using an in-house pipeline, a species-level assignment was given if > 50% of the genes matched the representative genome of a given species, with a mean identity ≥ 95% and mean gene length coverage ≥ 90%.

Materials and Methods Data Source The dataset was generated from 30 rabbit fecal samples subjected to deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The sequencing data is available under the BioProject PRJEB50625. Metagenomic Assembly Raw sequencing reads were first pre-processed using fastp for adapter removal and quality trimming. Host-derived reads were filtered out by mapping to the rabbit reference genome (GCF_000001635.27) using Bowtie2 and removing mapped reads with Samtools. Each sample was individually assembled using metaSPAdes. Contigs shorter than 1,500 bp were excluded from downstream analysis. MAG Recovery Reads from each sample were mapped to all 30 assemblies (30×30 mappings) using Bowtie2. The resulting alignments were sorted and indexed with Samtools. Contig coverage across all samples was computed using `jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths`. Binning was performed with MetaBAT 2 and SemiBin v1.3. MAG quality was assessed with CheckM. Only high-quality MAGs (≥70% completeness, ≤5% contamination, N50 ≥ 8 kb) were retained. Non-Redundant Gene Catalog Gene prediction was carried out using Prodigal on all contigs from the current study (with `-m -p meta`). Genes shorter than 90 bp or lacking start/stop codons were discarded. The remaining genes from both sources were pooled and clustered using CD-HIT-EST (parameters: `-c 0.95 -aS 0.90 -G 0 -d 0 -M 0 -T 0`). The longest contigs were used to select representative genes. MSP Recovery Shotgun reads from the 30 samples were aligned to the non-redundant gene catalog using the Meteor suite, generating a gene abundance matrix (5.7 million genes × 30 samples). Co-abundant genes were grouped into 1,053 Metagenomic Species Pan-genomes (MSPs) using MSPminer.

The BioProjects associated with the cohorts are : PRJDB4176 (JPN, 645 individuals, 286 CRC patients) PRJEB10878 (CHN, 128 individuals, 74 CRC patients) PRJEB12449 (USA, 104 individuals, 52 CRC patients) PRJEB27928 (GER, 82 individuals, 22 CRC patients) PRJEB6070 (FRA, 156 individuals, 53 CRC patients - GER, 43 individuals, 38 CRC patients) PRJEB7774 (AUT, 156 individuals, 46 CRC patients) PRJNA389927 (USA, 56 individuals, 26 CRC patients - CAN, 28 individuals, 2 CRC patients) PRJNA397112 (IND, 110 individuals, no patients) PRJNA447983 (ITA, 140 individuals, 61 CRC patients) PRJNA531273 (IND, 30 individuals, 30 CRC patients) PRJNA608088 (CHN, 18 individuals, 6 CRC patients) PRJNA429097 (CHN, 193 individuals, 98 CRC patients) PRJNA763023 (CHN, 200 individuals, 100 CRC patients) PRJNA731589 (CHN, 161 individuals, 76 CRC patients) PRJNA961076 (BRA, 90 individuals, 30 CRC patients) Data processing Sequencing data was downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive. Reads were quality trimmed and filtered from sequencing adapters using fastp. Remaining contamination by the host genome was filtered out by mapping reads against the human reference genome (T2T-CHM13v2.0) with bowtie2. Microbial species identification and quantification was estimated according to both human gut reference gene catalogue (IGC2, 10.4M genes) and human oral gene catalogue (8.4M genes) clustered into Metagenomic Species Pangenomes taxonomically and functionally annotated. Data provided The data associated with the cohorts are : Metagenomic Species abundance/count tables among samples and associated taxonomy with METEOR, Metaphlan4 and Sylph (GTDB version RS214) Functional modules abundance among samples and associated annotation with METEOR (KEGG version 92) Strain abundance table with METEOR Metagenomic Species and functional modules abundance/count tables batch effect correction with both 0% and 10% species prevalence filter. Manually curated metadata : All but 6 gut metagenomic samples from the 14 public projects are listed (96 virome samples from PRJNA389927 and 6 samples from PRJEB12449 not described in the associated paper and with no health status were discarded). A quality check was performed and 104 samples were identified as contaminated. They are listed in the metadata file but proposed to be suppressed.

How to use this dataset Create a gene abundance table by aligning reads from each sample against the catalog. For this purpose, you can use Meteor or NGLess. Then, normalize raw counts by gene length. Taxonomic profiling: the abundance of each species can be estimated as the average abundance of its 100 first core genes. To reduce the false positive rate, only consider that a species is present if at least 10/100 marker genes are detected. Methods Data sources This dataset was constructed using two different bioprojects: PRJNA758898 from Ma et al. 2022. 16 samples from 16 animals. PRJEB9357 from Deusch et al. 2015. 88 samples from 30 animals. PRJEB4391 from Deusch et al. 2014. 36 samples from 18 animals. PRJNA944553. 30 samples from 30 animals. PRJNA908260 from Bai et al. 2023. 8 samples from 8 animals. PRJNA923753 from Ho et al. 2023. 1 sample. Metagenomic assembly De novo metagenomic assembly was performed on samples listed above. First, sequencing adapters removal and read trimming was performed with fastp. Reads mapped on the host genome (GCF_018350175.1) with bowtie2 were removed with samtools. Finally, Metagenomic assembly was performed with metaSPAdes. Contigs of less than 1500 bp were removed. MAGs recovery MAGs were generated with COMEBin (multi-coverage mode) and MAGs quality was assessed with CheckM2. MAGs with completeness < 70% or contamination > 5% or N50 < 5Kb were discarded. Pairwise Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) was computed for all recovered MAGs with fastANI and dereplication at species level (ANI cutoff = 95%). Non-redundant gene catalog Genes were predicted on all contigs from metagenomic assemblies with Prodigal (parameters : -m -p meta). Genes were pooled and clustered with cd-hit-est (parameters -c 0.95 -aS 0.90 -G 0 -d 0 -M 0 -T 0) by choosing those from the longest contigs as representatives. MSPs recovery Samples from multiple cohorts (listed above + PRJNA906124 from Lee et al. 2022) were aligned against the non-redundant gene catalog with the Meteor software suite to produce a raw gene abundance table (1,3M genes quantified in 212 samples). Then, co-abundant genes were binned in 344 Metagenomic Species Pan-genomes (MSPs, i.e. gene clusters that likely belong to the same microbial species) using MSPminer. MAGs and MSPs taxonomic annotation Dereplicated MAGs were annotated with GTDB-Tk based on GTDB r214. Then, MAGs taxonomic annotation was propagated to the corresponding MSPs. Construction of the phylogenetic tree 39 universal phylogenetic markers genes were extracted from the dereplicated MAGs with fetchMGs. Then, the markers were separately aligned with MUSCLE. The 40 alignments were merged and trimmed with trimAl (parameters: -automated1). Finally, the phylogenetic tree was computed with FastTreeMP (parameters: -gamma -pseudo -spr -mlacc 3 -slownni).","published_at":"2023-10-11T09:58:03Z","publisher":"MetaGenoPolis","citationHtml":"PLAZA ONATE, Florian, 2023, \"A catalog of genes, genomes and species of the cat (Felis catus) intestinal microbiota\", <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.57745/1FIHIT\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.57745/1FIHIT</a>, Recherche Data Gouv, V1, UNF:6:Yxw+1mDpJyLdntrP3PF1wQ== [fileUNF]","identifier_of_dataverse":"mgp","name_of_dataverse":"MetaGenoPolis","citation":"PLAZA ONATE, Florian, 2023, \"A catalog of genes, genomes and species of the cat (Felis catus) intestinal microbiota\", https://doi.org/10.57745/1FIHIT, Recherche Data Gouv, V1, UNF:6:Yxw+1mDpJyLdntrP3PF1wQ== [fileUNF]","storageIdentifier":"inrae://10.57745/1FIHIT","subjects":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"],"fileCount":7,"versionId":269578,"versionState":"RELEASED","majorVersion":1,"minorVersion":0,"createdAt":"2023-10-10T14:04:59Z","updatedAt":"2023-10-11T09:58:03Z","contacts":[{"name":"PLAZA ONATE, Florian","affiliation":"INRAE"}],"publications":[{}],"geographicCoverage":[{"country":""}],"authors":["PLAZA ONATE, Florian"]},{"name":"MINTIA paper Biological samples","type":"dataset","url":"https://doi.org/10.15454/AH8CRS","global_id":"doi:10.15454/AH8CRS","description":"Reads corresponding to the biological samples initially analysed in \"Investigating Host Microbiota Relationships Through Functional Metagenomics\" of Laville et al and used to validate MINTIA pipeline on biological samples.

Methods Data Sources The oral gene catalog was built using three primary sources: Bacterial Genomes from the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD). Fungal Genomes from the NCBI RefSeq database. Metagenomic Sequencing Data from multiple oral microbiome studies. The creation of the oral gene catalog was a multi-step process, combining and refining genes from each source Bacterial Genes A total of 1,505 bacterial genomes were downloaded from HOMD (version 20170215, accessed in December 2017). Genes shorter than 60 nucleotides or containing ambiguous bases were filtered out. Redundancy was removed using CD-HIT-EST (v4.6; parameters: -aS 0.9 -c 0.95 -T 0 -M 0 -t 0 -d 0 -G 0).

After initial redundancy removal with CD-HIT-EST (v4.6; parameters: -aS 0.9 -c 0.95 -T 0 -M 0 -t 0 -d 0 -G 0), genes were selected for inclusion only if their corresponding genome was present in at least 20% of the samples in one of the metagenomic cohorts, determined by mapping reads with Bowtie2 (v2.2.3). This led to the selection of 2,440,644 fungal genes. Metagenomic Sequencing Data The gene catalog was supplemented with data from 689 oral metagenomes, including newly sequenced samples, from the following studies: Human Microbiome Project (HMP): 382 samples (bioproject PRJNA255439). Chinese Cohort: 212 samples (bioproject PRJEB6997). TwinsUK Cohort: 48 newly sequenced samples (bioproject: PRJEB38483). Raw reads were subjected to quality control and trimmed using AlienTrimmer 0.4.0 (parameters: -k 10 -l 45 -m 5 -p 40 -q 20). Human sequences were removed by mapping against the human reference genome (GRCh38.p11) using Bowtie2 2.2.3. Metagenomic assembly was performed using SPAdes 3.9.0 (parameters: “-k 21,33,55 --only-assembler –meta” for Illumina paired-end data, or “--iontorrent -t 24 -m 300 -k 21,33,55 --only-assembler” for Ion Torrent single-end data). Contigs shorter than 500 bp or with coverage less than 2x were discarded. Gene calling was conducted with Prodigal (parameters: -m -p meta). Genes shorter than 60 bp were filtered out, and redundancy was removed with CD-HIT-EST (v4.6; parameters: -aS 0.9 -c 0.95 -T 0 -M 0 -t 0 -d 0 -G 0). Final Gene Catalog The final gene catalog was assembled by sequentially adding non-redundant genes from each data source. Genes from HOMD and fungal genomes were combined first using cd-hit-est-2d. Then, non-redundant genes from the HMP, Chinese, and TwinsUK cohorts were sequentially added using cd-hit-est-2d (same parameters as cd-hit-est). A final redundancy removal step was performed. This process resulted in a catalogue of 8.4 million non-redundant genes MSPs Recovery The 689 metagenomic samples were aligned against the final gene catalog using the Meteor software suite to produce a gene abundance table. Then, co-abundant genes were binned into 853 Metagenomic Species Pan-genomes (MSPs) using MSPminer. MSPs Taxonomic Annotation Taxonomic annotation for the MSPs was performed by aligning all core and accessory genes against representative genomes from the GTDB database (release r214) using blastn (task: megablast, word_size: 16). A species-level assignment was given if over 50% of the genes matched a representative genome with a mean nucleotide identity of at least 95% and a mean gene length coverage of at least 90%. The remaining MSPs were assigned to a higher taxonomic level (genus to superkingdom) if more than 50% of their genes shared the same annotation.","published_at":"2023-09-20T09:00:29Z","publisher":"Data INRAE","citationHtml":"Le Chatelier, Emmanuelle; Almeida, Mathieu; Plaza O&ntilde;ate, Florian; Pons, Nicolas; Gauthier, Franck; Ghozlane, Amine; Ehrlich, Stanislav Dusko; Witherden, Elizabeth; Gomez-Cabrero, David, 2021, \"A catalog of genes and species of the human oral microbiota\", <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.15454/WQ4UTV\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.15454/WQ4UTV</a>, Recherche Data Gouv, V3, UNF:6:6sWpxqAU7Fpf1wtE+EO7Kw== [fileUNF]","identifier_of_dataverse":"inrae","name_of_dataverse":"Data INRAE","citation":"Le Chatelier, Emmanuelle; Almeida, Mathieu; Plaza Oñate, Florian; Pons, Nicolas; Gauthier, Franck; Ghozlane, Amine; Ehrlich, Stanislav Dusko; Witherden, Elizabeth; Gomez-Cabrero, David, 2021, \"A catalog of genes and species of the human oral microbiota\", https://doi.org/10.15454/WQ4UTV, Recherche Data Gouv, V3, UNF:6:6sWpxqAU7Fpf1wtE+EO7Kw== [fileUNF]","storageIdentifier":"inrae://10.15454/WQ4UTV","subjects":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"],"fileCount":4,"versionId":269584,"versionState":"RELEASED","majorVersion":3,"minorVersion":1,"createdAt":"2021-07-06T14:21:00Z","updatedAt":"2025-08-12T12:57:00Z","contacts":[{"name":"Plaza Oñate, Florian","affiliation":"INRAE"}],"publications":[{}],"geographicCoverage":[{"country":""}],"authors":["Le Chatelier, Emmanuelle","Almeida, Mathieu","Plaza Oñate, Florian","Pons, Nicolas","Gauthier, Franck","Ghozlane, Amine","Ehrlich, Stanislav Dusko","Witherden, Elizabeth","Gomez-Cabrero, David"]},{"name":"MIMIC2: Murine Intestinal Microbiota Integrated Catalog v2","type":"dataset","url":"https://doi.org/10.15454/L11MXM","global_id":"doi:10.15454/L11MXM","description":"Dataset overview The MIMIC2 dataset provides: a non-redundant high-quality catalog of 5.0 million genes 6,967 Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) 1,252 Metagenomic Species Pangenomes (MSPs) This dataset can be used to analyze shotgun sequencing data of the murine gut microbiota. How to use this dataset Create a gene abundance table by aligning reads from each sample against the catalog. For this purpose, you can use Meteor or NGLess. Then, normalize raw counts by gene length. Taxonomic profiling: the abundance of each species can be estimated as the average abundance of its 100 first core genes. To reduce the false positive rate, only consider that a species is present if at least 10/100 marker genes are detected. Methods Data sources The MIMIC2 dataset was constructed using two different data sources: Source 1: the Mouse Gastrointestinal Bacterial Catalogue (MGBC) which is a compilation of 276 genomes from cultured isolates and 45,218 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 1,960 publicly available mouse metagenomes Source 2: 68 samples of Messaoudene et al. (PRJNA783624) and 85 deeply sequenced samples from bioproject CNP0000619 published by Xiao et al. Metagenomic assembly De novo metagenomic assembly was performed on the 153 samples from the data Source 2. First, sequencing adapters removal and read trimming was performed with fastp. Reads mapped on the host genome (GCF_000001635.27) with bowtie2 were removed with samtools. Finally, Metagenomic assembly was performed with metaSPAdes. Contigs of less than 1500 bp were removed. MAGs recovery Reads of each sample from the data Source 2 were aligned to their respective assembly with bowtie2 and results were indexed in sorted bam files with samtools. Then, contigs coverage was computed in each sample with jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths. MAGs were generated with MetaBAT 2 and MAGs quality was assessed with checkM. MAGs with completeness < 70% or contamination > 5% or N50 < 8Kb were discarded. Non-redundant gene catalog Genes were predicted on all contigs from the data Source 2 with Prodigal (parameters : -m -p meta ). Likewise, genes were predicted on all genomes from the data Source 1 (MGBC) with Prodigal (parameters : -m -p single ). Genes from the two data sources were pooled and those shorter than 90 bp or incomplete were discarded.

We further designed a novel specific synbiotic for CKD (SynCKD) that are able to decrease UTs in silico and in vitro. We tested a specific synbiotic (SynCKD) in a male mouse model of CKD induced by two-step 5/6 nephrectomy at 6 weeks of age. The mice were treated with either a placebo or the synbiotic for 6 weeks. Fecal samples were collected at the end of the treatment period for analysis. The in vivo efficacy of SynCKD was demonstrated by reduced plasma levels of uremic toxins (UTs) and improved kidney function after 6 tweeks of treatment.

The final table of size 1990 MSP by 216 individuals records all the normalized abundances.","published_at":"2023-07-27T09:51:29Z","publisher":"MetaGenoPolis","citationHtml":"Champion, Camille; Momal, Rapha&euml;lle; Le Chatelier, Emmanuelle; Mariadassou, Mahendra; Berland, Magali, 2023, \"Microbial species abundances from public project PRJEB6337 on liver cirrhosis\", <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.57745/5YXXN1\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.57745/5YXXN1</a>, Recherche Data Gouv, V2, UNF:6:7f3DRX3uw4IOt98ZGo/SHg== [fileUNF]","identifier_of_dataverse":"mgp","name_of_dataverse":"MetaGenoPolis","citation":"Champion, Camille; Momal, Raphaëlle; Le Chatelier, Emmanuelle; Mariadassou, Mahendra; Berland, Magali, 2023, \"Microbial species abundances from public project PRJEB6337 on liver cirrhosis\", https://doi.org/10.57745/5YXXN1, Recherche Data Gouv, V2, UNF:6:7f3DRX3uw4IOt98ZGo/SHg== [fileUNF]","storageIdentifier":"inrae://10.57745/5YXXN1","subjects":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Mathematical Sciences"],"fileCount":2,"versionId":268676,"versionState":"RELEASED","majorVersion":2,"minorVersion":0,"createdAt":"2023-05-04T16:15:49Z","updatedAt":"2023-07-27T09:51:29Z","contacts":[{"name":"Champion, Camille","affiliation":"INRAE"}],"authors":["Champion, Camille","Momal, Raphaëlle","Le Chatelier, Emmanuelle","Mariadassou, Mahendra","Berland, Magali"]},{"name":"Données de réplication pour : Microbial multiomics approach in understanding blue-veined cheeses bitterness","type":"dataset","url":"https://doi.org/10.57745/T4NXOM","global_id":"doi:10.57745/T4NXOM","description":"Microbial multiomics approach in understanding blue-veined cheeses bitterness Abstract Blue-veined cheeses are regularly described as bitter but links between microbial diversity, function, gene expression and bitterness have not been deciphered yet. In the present work, microbiological, biochemical, metabarcoding (amplicons sequencing), metagenomic (DNA-Seq) and metatranscriptomic (RNA-Seq) were combined to better understand the potential origins of excessive bitterness in semi-soft blue-veined PDO Bleu d’Auvergne cheeses by exploring microbial composition, function, expression, conjugated to physico-chemical analysis and sensorial analysis. Physicochemical analyses revealed significative cheese bitterness differences associated with multiples factors in milk and in several cheeses’ parameters. After 30 days of ripening, Low Bitter (LB) cheeses were characterized by a higher bacterial and yeasts richness and diversity while High Bitter (HB) cheeses were characterized by one most dominant filamentous fungus Penicillium roqueforti and one most dominant bacterial species Lactococcus lactis. It affected in return the use of resources presents in milk through preferential mobilization of metabolic pathways as fatty acid desaturation (HB) and fatty acid biosynthesis (LB). Increase of salt concentration modulated the microbial community which withstood with osmostress. Abundance, richness, diversity of bacteria, eukaryote especially yeasts, phages and mycovirus were differentially involved in resources utilization from milk proteins, regulating cheese bitterness.","published_at":"2026-01-13T15:20:56Z","publisher":"Data INRAE","citationHtml":"Theil, S&eacute;bastien; Michel, Elisa, 2026, \"Donn&eacute;es de r&eacute;plication pour : Microbial multiomics approach in understanding blue-veined cheeses bitterness\", <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.57745/T4NXOM\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.57745/T4NXOM</a>, Recherche Data Gouv, V1","identifier_of_dataverse":"inrae","name_of_dataverse":"Data INRAE","citation":"Theil, Sébastien; Michel, Elisa, 2026, \"Données de réplication pour : Microbial multiomics approach in understanding blue-veined cheeses bitterness\", https://doi.org/10.57745/T4NXOM, Recherche Data Gouv, V1","storageIdentifier":"inrae://10.57745/T4NXOM","keywords":["meta-omics","blue cheese (odour or aroma)"],"subjects":["Earth and Environmental Sciences","Engineering","Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Computer and Information Science","Agricultural Sciences"],"fileCount":1,"versionId":282532,"versionState":"RELEASED","majorVersion":1,"minorVersion":0,"createdAt":"2026-01-12T15:49:38Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T15:20:56Z","contacts":[{"name":"Theil, Sébastien","affiliation":"INRAE"},{"name":"Michel, Elisa","affiliation":"INRAE"}],"publications":[{}],"producers":["Unité Mixte de Recherche sur le Fromage"],"relatedMaterial":["https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB105406"],"geographicCoverage":[{"country":""}],"authors":["Theil, Sébastien","Michel, Elisa"]},{"name":"Supplementary tables to manuscript: “Comparison of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and Virion-associated nucleic acids (VANA) metagenomic approaches for phytovirome analyses”","type":"dataset","url":"https://doi.org/10.15454/OAKDVI","global_id":"doi:10.15454/OAKDVI","description":"Supplementary tables to manuscript in Chapter 2","published_at":"2019-07-31T11:52:33Z","publisher":"Data INRAE","citationHtml":"Ma, Yuxin; Marais, Armelle; Lefebvre, Marie; Theil, Sebastien; Svanella-Dumas, Laurence; Faure, Chantal; Candresse, Thierry, 2019, \"Supplementary tables to manuscript: &ldquo;Comparison of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and Virion-associated nucleic acids (VANA) metagenomic approaches for phytovirome analyses&rdquo;\", <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.15454/OAKDVI\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.15454/OAKDVI</a>, Recherche Data Gouv, V1, UNF:6:UoaxapZDJcV5rZNUqGRuqQ== [fileUNF]","identifier_of_dataverse":"inrae","name_of_dataverse":"Data INRAE","citation":"Ma, Yuxin; Marais, Armelle; Lefebvre, Marie; Theil, Sebastien; Svanella-Dumas, Laurence; Faure, Chantal; Candresse, Thierry, 2019, \"Supplementary tables to manuscript: “Comparison of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and Virion-associated nucleic acids (VANA) metagenomic approaches for phytovirome analyses”\", https://doi.org/10.15454/OAKDVI, Recherche Data Gouv, V1, UNF:6:UoaxapZDJcV5rZNUqGRuqQ== [fileUNF]","storageIdentifier":"inrae://10.15454/OAKDVI","subjects":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"],"fileCount":6,"versionId":191817,"versionState":"RELEASED","majorVersion":1,"minorVersion":0,"createdAt":"2019-07-31T08:47:58Z","updatedAt":"2019-07-31T11:52:33Z","contacts":[{"name":"Candresse, Thierry","affiliation":"INRA - Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique"}],"authors":["Ma, Yuxin","Marais, Armelle","Lefebvre, Marie","Theil, Sebastien","Svanella-Dumas, Laurence","Faure, Chantal","Candresse, Thierry"]},{"name":"Viral metagenomic data of crop and wild plant/weed species in horticultural contexts: analysis of viral diversity, prevalence and stability over a two-year period","type":"dataset","url":"https://doi.org/10.15454/5BLYMJ","global_id":"doi:10.15454/5BLYMJ","description":"Using purified double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) on a 454 pyrosequencing platform, we analyzed the metavirome associated with crops and surrounding weeds/wild plants in horticultural contexts in southwestern France.

Persons living with HIV (PWH) present microbiome alterations (higher abundance of Prevotella and lower abundance of Firmicutes and Ruminococcus lineages) vs. non-infected individuals. Some of these alterations are linked to sexual preference and others to the HIV infection. The relationship between these lineages and metabolic alterations, often present in aging PWH, has been poorly investigated. In this study, we compared fecal quantitative metagenomics profiles of 25 antiretroviral-treatment (ART)-controlled PWH to three independent control groups of 25 non-infected matched individuals by means of univariate analyses and machine learning methods. Moreover, we used two external datasets to validate predictive models of PWH classification. We analyzed associations between clinical and biological metabolic parameters and taxonomic and functional microbiome profiles. Finally, we quantified the altered microbiome signatures in 7 PWH after a 17-week ART switch to raltegravir/maraviroc. Results. Three major enterotypes (Prevotella, Bacteroides and Ruminococcaceae) were present in all groups. The first Prevotella enterotype was enriched in PWH, with several of its lineages associated with poor metabolic profiles (low HDL and adiponectin, high insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)). Conversely butyrate-producing lineages were markedly depleted in PWH independently of sexual preference and were associated with a better metabolic profile (higher HDL and adiponectin and lower HOMA-IR). Accordingly, butyrate production and amino-acid degradation modules were associated with high HDL and adiponectin and low HOMA-IR. Random Forest models trained to classify PWH vs. control on taxonomic abundances displayed high generalization performance on two external holdout datasets (ROC AUC of 80-82%). Finally, no significant alterations in microbiome composition were observed after switching to raltegravir/maraviroc. Conclusion. High resolution metagenomic analyses revealed major differences in the gut microbiome of ART-controlled PWH when compared with three independent matched cohorts of controls. The observed marked insulin resistance could result both from enrichment in Prevotella lineages, and from the depletion in species producing butyrate and involved into amino-acid degradation, which depletion is linked with the HIV infection.","published_at":"2024-01-19T20:43:38Z","publisher":"MetaGenoPolis","citationHtml":"Belda, Eugeni; Capeau, Jacqueline; Zucker, Jean-Daniel; Le Chatelier, Emmanuelle; Pons, Nicolas; Alili, Rohia; Fellahi, Soraya; Katlama, Christine; Cl&eacute;ment, Karine; F&egrave;ve, Bruno; Goujard, C&eacute;cile; Lambotte, Olivier; Dor&eacute;, Jo&euml;l; Prifti, Edi; Bastard, Jean-Philippe, 2024, \"Major depletion in the insulin-sensitive signature of the gut microbiome in antiretroviral treatment-controlled persons living with HIV\", <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.57745/UOVSPM\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.57745/UOVSPM</a>, Recherche Data Gouv, V1","identifier_of_dataverse":"mgp","name_of_dataverse":"MetaGenoPolis","citation":"Belda, Eugeni; Capeau, Jacqueline; Zucker, Jean-Daniel; Le Chatelier, Emmanuelle; Pons, Nicolas; Alili, Rohia; Fellahi, Soraya; Katlama, Christine; Clément, Karine; Fève, Bruno; Goujard, Cécile; Lambotte, Olivier; Doré, Joël; Prifti, Edi; Bastard, Jean-Philippe, 2024, \"Major depletion in the insulin-sensitive signature of the gut microbiome in antiretroviral treatment-controlled persons living with HIV\", https://doi.org/10.57745/UOVSPM, Recherche Data Gouv, V1","storageIdentifier":"inrae://10.57745/UOVSPM","keywords":["Metagenomics"],"subjects":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Computer and Information Science"],"fileCount":139,"versionId":269807,"versionState":"RELEASED","majorVersion":1,"minorVersion":0,"createdAt":"2023-11-15T07:39:56Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-19T20:43:38Z","contacts":[{"name":"Pons, Nicolas","affiliation":"INRAE"}],"authors":["Belda, Eugeni","Capeau, Jacqueline","Zucker, Jean-Daniel","Le Chatelier, Emmanuelle","Pons, Nicolas","Alili, Rohia","Fellahi, Soraya","Katlama, Christine","Clément, Karine","Fève, Bruno","Goujard, Cécile","Lambotte, Olivier","Doré, Joël","Prifti, Edi","Bastard, Jean-Philippe"]},{"name":"Metagenomic data associated (raw, merged, normalized and analyzed) associated to the evaluation of the preventive treatments for intestinal mucositis in a murine model using Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus L156.4 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus","type":"dataset","url":"https://doi.org/10.57745/2WXOS0","global_id":"doi:10.57745/2WXOS0","description":"Shotgun metagenomic sequencing data were generated from fecal samples collected from BALB/c mice treated with live, inactivated, or supernatant preparations of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus L156.4 or LGG, as part of a 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis model.

For each sample, DNA has been extracted, a fragment amplified (a marker of 312 bp in rbcL fragment), and sequenced. Next, all pairwise distances between reads have been computed (from Smith-Waterman local alignment score), within and between samples. This has led to 55 hdf5 files organized each as follows as far as h5 datasets are concerned: sequence identifiers (seqid): one h5 dataset if within a sample, two if between samples sequences (word): one h5 dataset if within a sample, two if between samples pairwise distances between sequences (h5 dataset distances). Pairwise distances have been computed through DARI project i2015037360 (8 millions of hours, 2016, give, to AF) at IDRIS on Turing and Ada machines. As there are 10 samples, there are 10 files for within sample distances, and 45 files (n(n-1)/2 with n=10) for between samples istances. There are 55 hdf5 samples, labeled L1 to L10 within each sample, and Lx_Ly beween samples, with x < y .

Microorganisms inhabiting wheat leaves might act as beneficial, biocontrol or facilitating agents that could limit or stimulate the development of Z. tritici. Improving our understanding of microbial communities in the wheat phyllosphere would lead to new insights into STB management. The current resource announcement details the fungal and bacterial metabarcoding datasets obtained by sampling wheat leaves infected by Z. tritici. Tissues with different symptomatology were sampled from three wheat commercial varieties on different sampling dates during a cropping season. Weeds around wheat fields were sampled as complements to the wheat datasets. In total, more than 450 samples were collected. The presence of the pathogen Z. tritici was also quantified using qPCR. We provide the raw metabarcoding datasets, the Amplicon Sequence Variant (ASV) tables obtained after bioinformatic processing, the metadata describing sampling dates, wheat varieties and tissue health condition, a preliminary descriptive analysis of the data, and the code used for bioinformatic and descriptive statistical analysis.","published_at":"2022-10-28T11:07:08Z","publisher":"Data INRAE","citationHtml":"Barroso Bergada, Didac, 2022, \"NGS data revealing the phyllosphere microbiome of wheat plants infected by the fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici\", <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.15454/QTXFP9\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.15454/QTXFP9</a>, Recherche Data Gouv, V2, UNF:6:gteYSBMsBeWuHd6lQh6MOg== [fileUNF]","identifier_of_dataverse":"inrae","name_of_dataverse":"Data INRAE","citation":"Barroso Bergada, Didac, 2022, \"NGS data revealing the phyllosphere microbiome of wheat plants infected by the fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici\", https://doi.org/10.15454/QTXFP9, Recherche Data Gouv, V2, UNF:6:gteYSBMsBeWuHd6lQh6MOg== [fileUNF]","storageIdentifier":"inrae://10.15454/QTXFP9","keywords":["Zymoseptoria tritici","Metagenomics","Wheat"],"subjects":["Agricultural Sciences"],"fileCount":18,"versionId":264338,"versionState":"RELEASED","majorVersion":2,"minorVersion":0,"createdAt":"2022-01-27T09:44:38Z","updatedAt":"2022-10-28T11:07:08Z","contacts":[{"name":"Barroso Bergada, Didac","affiliation":"INRAE"}],"authors":["Barroso Bergada, Didac"]},{"name":"Replication Data for: Diversity of soil bacterial communities in response to fonio genotypes and pedoclimatic conditions in Benin","type":"dataset","url":"https://doi.org/10.57745/FQAJBU","global_id":"doi:10.57745/FQAJBU","description":"This dataset comprises environmental DNA (eDNA) sequences obtained from the rhizosphere of Digitaria exilis (fonio), a cereal crop cultivated in West Africa.

Context and description: Chagas disease (CD) is a zoonotic parasitic disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, mainly transmitted to mammals through feces and urine of triatomines known as kissing bugs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae). Triatoma dimidiata is the main vector of CD in the Yucatan Peninsula (YP). To better understand ecological interactions shaping transmission cycles of T. cruzi in a sylvatic ecotope of the YP, a metabarcoding approach was used to simultaneously identify vector blood meals, gut microbiome composition, genetic diversity, as well as T. cruzi genetic diversity from a sample of 33 T. dimidiata individuals collected in 2019 by the owner of an isolated rural dwelling on a conserved sylvatic site of the Balam Kú State Reserve (Campeche, Mexico). Infection prevalence with T. cruzi was 27.3% (9/33). We identified thirteen blood-meal sources (the most prevalent being Homo sapiens, Sus scrofa, Mus musculus), six bacterial Orders (Bacillales, Oceanospirillales and Micrococcales being the most abundant), two T. cruzi DTUs (TcI and TcIV), as well as two T. dimidiata genetic subgroups (ITS-2 Haplogroups 2 and 3).","published_at":"2025-05-16T00:00:44Z","publisher":"Institut de Recherche pour le Développement","citationHtml":"Manzanilla, Vincent; Barnab&eacute;, Christian; Guilhem, Semp&eacute;r&eacute;; Millan, Joel Moo; Waleckx, Etienne, 2024, \"mbctools: A User-Friendly Metabarcoding and Cross-Platform Pipeline for Analyzing Multiple Amplicon Sequencing Data across a Large Diversity of Organisms\", <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.23708/W3TODJ\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.23708/W3TODJ</a>","identifier_of_dataverse":"ird","name_of_dataverse":"Institut de Recherche pour le Développement","citation":"Manzanilla, Vincent; Barnabé, Christian; Guilhem, Sempéré; Millan, Joel Moo; Waleckx, Etienne, 2024, \"mbctools: A User-Friendly Metabarcoding and Cross-Platform Pipeline for Analyzing Multiple Amplicon Sequencing Data across a Large Diversity of Organisms\", https://doi.org/10.23708/W3TODJ","storageIdentifier":"ird://10.23708/W3TODJ","keywords":["Computer and Information Science","Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","metabarcoding","metagenomics","ecology","amplicon","reproducibility","VSEARCH","bioinformatics","pipeline"],"subjects":[""],"fileCount":0,"versionId":282465,"versionState":"RELEASED","createdAt":"2026-01-09T10:38:33Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T10:38:33Z","contacts":[{"name":"","affiliation":""}],"producers":["DataSuds"],"authors":["Manzanilla, Vincent","Barnabé, Christian","Guilhem, Sempéré","Millan, Joel Moo","Waleckx, Etienne"]}],"count_in_response":107}}
