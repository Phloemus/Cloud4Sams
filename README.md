# Cloud4Sams Webportal

The Cloud4Sams project aims at creating a repository of metagenomics tools and data.

## Objectives

The Cloud4Sams project has 3 main objectives:

- Proposing a catalog of tools and data
- Allowing users to find the tool and data they need effectively
- Launching a tool in secure bubble

## The Cloud4Sams Webportal

The webportal of Cloud4Sams should allow users to access a wide catalog of metagenomics tools and data and browse in 
them effectilevy as well as provide a small tool that allows users to select the launch of a tool even though the 
webportal should be connected to a backend to unlock the full feature.

## Data harvesting

Data harvesting is key to provide a large ecosystem of tools and data that the user may want to use. Focused on 
metagenomics data, the catalog of Cloud4Sams is composed on tools and data already made public in the following 
repositories 

### Metagenomics data
